OUR CONTRIBUTION:
#Since 2014, 5000+ candidates of all age groups have taken up Yoga &amp; Pilates Teacher Training -
online &amp; offline- from Everest &amp; they have transformed their life &amp; further transforming others!!!
#We effectively launched programs - MISSION VIJAY CORONA &amp; GHAR GHAR YOGA during
pandemic COVID 19 in March 2020. This was an online program where we connected yoga leaders,
yoga teachers, health care workers &amp; healers from all over the world and everyone rendered their
services on our online platform. The intention behind the program was to unconditionally serve
humanity to stay balanced, while the entire human race was restricted within the four walls.
#We delivered 50 hours nonstop live online-sessions during pandemic COVID 19, on yogic practices,
naturopathy, ayurveda &amp; other forms of health &amp; fitness. These sessions were free of cost for
everyone to practice &amp; keep up good health. This attempt was highly appreciated by the online
community &amp; helped us create a global yogic family.
- वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् (vasudhaiva kutumbakam)
(Sanskrit phrase from Maha Upanishad, that means that the whole world is one single family.)
